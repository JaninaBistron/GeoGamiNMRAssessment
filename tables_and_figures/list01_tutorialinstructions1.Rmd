- We are scientists and the idea of the game is to learn more about the way children use maps for orientation.

- At the end of the game, the participant will find a treasure.

- It is not a problem, if the participant makes mistakes or solves tasks wrongly. He/she will nevertheless find the treasure. However, we want the participant to endeavor in the game in order to help us for our research.

- During the game, there will be no feedback on the participant's solutions or answers. He/she will not know, if the solution was right or wrong, but if he/her is interested, we can give this information afterwards.

- During the game, it is allowed to ask questions (e.g. when the task types or symbols are unclear), but it is possible that we are not allowed to answer these question (in order not to falsify the results).

- It is allowed to take breaks during the game (to drink, eat, and rest) or to cancel the game.

- We will accompany the participant during the game in order to answer questions, see if the app works, and learn more about the way the participants use a map to orientate.
